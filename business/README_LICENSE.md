# Licensing & Commercial Notes

This project includes a proprietary license by default (`LICENSE.txt`). For commercial distribution, follow these guidelines:

- Keep `LICENSE.txt` in the project root and update contact details before distribution.
- Use `business/pricing.md` to document pricing tiers and add-on services.
- Consider adding a subscription terms document and a customer SLA.

For open-source or dual-licensed releases, create a separate branch and replace `LICENSE.txt` with an appropriate OSS license.
