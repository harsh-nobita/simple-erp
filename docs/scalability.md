# Scalability & Architecture Recommendations

This document lists recommendations for scaling the ERP to enterprise loads.

1) Caching
   - Use Redis for application-level caching (Flask-Caching) to cache expensive DB reads and computed KPIs.
   - Cache query results for dashboards and invalidate on relevant writes.

2) Background jobs
   - Use Celery (with Redis/RabbitMQ) or RQ for long-running tasks: report generation, PDF exports, backups, notifications.
   - Move blocking calls (third-party API calls, PDF creation) to background workers.

3) Asynchronous task handling
   - For webhooks and external integrations, process events asynchronously and acknowledge quickly.

4) Logging & Monitoring
   - Centralize logs using a logging stack (Filebeat -> ELK) or cloud logging (Datadog, CloudWatch).
   - Add structured JSON logging and error alerts.

5) Database scaling & multi-tenancy
   - For multi-company support: choose schema-per-tenant or shared schema with company_id scoping. Start with shared schema + company_id columns and row-level security as needed.
   - Use read replicas for reporting heavy reads; use connection pooling.

6) Security & Secrets
   - Use environment variables or a secrets manager for API keys/DB credentials.

7) Deployment
   - Containerize with Docker; use Kubernetes or managed container services for orchestration.

8) Observability
   - Add metrics (Prometheus) and dashboarding (Grafana) for latency, worker queue lengths, failed jobs.
